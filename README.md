## Acknowledgments

We are deeply grateful to all naturalists who carried out fieldwork in the Neotropics over several decades and collected the information used to build our dataset. Judith Bronstein gave invaluable suggestions for an early draft of this study. Paulo Guimarães Jr., Tiago Quental, and Thomas Lewinsohn discussed with us the assembly rules of interaction networks. Pedro Jordano, Carsten Dormann, and Katherine Ognyanova gave us invaluable tips on how to analyze and draw networks in R. Mark White and the StackOverflow community helped us build the [model used in the latent variable analysis](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44114501/model-identification-in-lavaan-for-r).
